            Migrations are Swift types in your package, discovered at build \
            time, so running them means building your project — a globally \
            installed binary cannot know what `CreateUsers.up(_:)` does. This \
            command builds and runs `migrate` for you.

            The connection URL comes from --database-url, then \
            $FLIGHT_DATABASE_URL, then $DATABASE_URL.

            `flight migrate init` is handled here rather than passed through: \
            it adds the migration targets to a project that has none.
