# Building a Flight application

A checkpoint-driven walkthrough that builds one application in three parts.
Each part ends at a project you can download and run — the same three the
starter site offers:

| Part | Ends at | You will have built |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | [`templates/skeleton`](templates/skeleton) | Configuration, dependency injection, HTTP, health endpoints |
| **2** | [`templates/basics`](templates/basics) | Entities, migrations, a repository, CRUD over Postgres |
| **3** | [`templates/demo`](templates/demo) | Real-time chat: PubSub, Channels, Presence, caching, authentication |

Every stage ends with a **Checkpoint** — a command and what you should see.
Don't move on until it passes; every later stage assumes the earlier ones.

The three templates are not three separate samples. Part 1's files are a
subset of Part 2's, and Part 2's a subset of Part 3's — checked mechanically
in CI. That is what lets each stage below be a real diff rather than prose
that drifts from the code. If a stage and its template ever disagree, the
template is right and the tutorial has a bug.

## What you need

- Swift 6.2 or later (`swift --version`)
- Docker, from Part 2 onward, for Postgres
- No prior Flight knowledge; some Swift concurrency will help in Part 3

## The shape of a Flight application

Three ideas carry most of the framework, and they are worth having in mind
before any code:

**Registration happens at build time.** A build plugin scans your target for
`@Controller`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Component`, and generates the
registration code. Adding a controller does not mean editing a list. A
misspelled configuration key is a compile error, not a 3am page.

**Composition is by module, and modules form a DAG.** You choose behaviour by
adding a module to `bootstrap`, and the framework orders them. Choosing an
HTTP transport is choosing a module. So is adding a database, a cache, or
authentication.

**Scopes are explicit.** A `.scoped` component lives for one request and holds
one pooled database connection for that request. Resolving one outside a scope
is an error rather than a silently new connection — which is what makes
"which connection is this query on?" always answerable.

# Part 1 — The skeleton

## Stage 1.1 — A package

Create a directory and a `Package.swift`:

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 6.2
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "App",
    platforms: [.macOS(.v15)],
    products: [
        .executable(name: "App", targets: ["App"])
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/Swift-Flight/flight.git", from: "0.1.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .executableTarget(
            name: "App",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "FlightCore", package: "flight"),
                .product(name: "FlightWeb", package: "flight"),
                .product(name: "FlightTransport", package: "flight"),
                .product(name: "FlightActuator", package: "flight"),
            ],
            plugins: [
                .plugin(name: "FlightRegistrationPlugin", package: "flight")
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```

One package dependency gives you four products. `flight` is a single package
with many library products, so you take what you use.

**`FlightTransport` deserves a note.** Flight Web owns routing, middleware,
and the request/response model; it does not own a socket. `FlightTransport`
is the default transport, wrapping HummingbirdCore — a mature, versioned HTTP
implementation. Flight does not hand-roll HTTP parsing, and any conforming
transport is a peer of this one.

**The plugin is not optional decoration.** It generates `flightRegisterAll`
from what it finds in your sources, and checks your `@ConfigValue` keys
against `flight.yaml` at build time.

### Checkpoint

```bash
swift build
```

Downloads the framework and succeeds with no targets to compile yet.

## Stage 1.2 — Configuration

Create `flight.yaml` beside `Package.swift`:

```yaml
app:
  name: App

server:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080

actuator:
  format: json
```

Flight Config layers sources: this file, then `FLIGHT_*` environment
variables over it, then anything a module contributes. The result is frozen
into an immutable `Configuration` at bootstrap. **Nothing re-reads this file
at runtime** — a configuration value cannot change under a running request,
which is why `Configuration` is safe to hold anywhere.

`FLIGHT_SERVER_PORT=9090 swift run App` overrides the port without editing
the file. The mapping is mechanical: dots become underscores, uppercased.

## Stage 1.3 — Bootstrap

Create `Sources/App/Main.swift`:

```swift
import FlightActuator
import FlightCore
import FlightTransport
import FlightWeb

struct AppModule: FlightModule {
    static var dependencies: [any FlightModule.Type] { [] }

    func configure(_ container: Container) throws {
        try flightRegisterAll(container)
    }
}

@main
struct Main {
    static func main() async throws {
        try await Flight.bootstrap(
            configuration: try Configuration.load(),
            modules: [
                FlightWebModule<FlightTransport>.self,
                AppModule.self,
                ActuatorModule.self,
            ]
        )
    }
}
```

`flightRegisterAll` does not exist in any file you wrote — the plugin
generates it. It will be empty until Stage 1.4, and that is fine.

What `bootstrap` does, in order: load configuration, build the container,
resolve the module DAG, run every `configure` serially, **freeze** the
container, then start services. Registration and use are separate phases, so
nothing serves traffic against a half-registered container, and a missing
dependency fails at startup naming what was missing.

### Checkpoint

```bash
swift run App
```

Starts and logs its bound address. `curl localhost:8080/actuator/health`
returns JSON. Every route 404s, because you have not written one. Ctrl-C.

## Stage 1.4 — A route

Create `Sources/App/Controllers/HealthController.swift`:

```swift
import FlightCore
import FlightWeb

@Controller
struct HealthController {
    @ConfigValue("app.name") var appName: String

    @GetMapping("/")
    func index(_ context: RequestContext) -> String {
        "\(appName) is flying"
    }
}
```

Nothing registers this controller by hand. The plugin found it.

`@ConfigValue` with no `default:` is checked at **build** time against
`flight.yaml`. Try misspelling it as `app.nmae` and rebuild: the build fails
naming the key. That check is the reason to prefer `@ConfigValue` over
reading `Configuration` directly.

### Checkpoint

```bash
swift run App &
curl localhost:8080/          # → App is flying
curl localhost:8080/actuator/health
kill %1
```

## Stage 1.5 — A test

Create `Sources/App/Entities/`, `Sources/App/Repos/`, and
`Sources/App/Services/` now — empty, but Part 2 fills them, and the layout is
worth having from the start.

Add the test target to `Package.swift`:

```swift
.testTarget(
    name: "AppTests",
    dependencies: [
        "App",
        .product(name: "FlightCore", package: "flight"),
        .product(name: "FlightWeb", package: "flight"),
        .product(name: "FlightWebTesting", package: "flight"),
    ]
)
```

And `Tests/AppTests/HealthControllerTests.swift`:

```swift
import FlightCore
import FlightWeb
import FlightWebTesting
import Testing

@testable import App

@Suite("Health route")
struct HealthControllerTests {
    @Test("the index route answers with the configured application name")
    func index() async throws {
        let container = try TestContainer.build(
            configuration: Configuration(values: ["app.name": "TestApp"])
        ) {
            AppModule()
        }
        let client = try TestClient(container: container)

        let response = await client.get("/")

        #expect(response.status == .ok)
        #expect(response.bodyText == "TestApp is flying")
    }
}
```

`TestClient` dispatches **in process**. There is no socket and no port to
collide with, but routing, middleware, dependency injection, configuration,
and encoding all run for real. Tests are fast because the socket is absent,
not because the framework is stubbed.

### Checkpoint

```bash
swift test        # 1 test passes
```

**You have now built [`templates/skeleton`](templates/skeleton).** Compare if
you like — it should match file for file.

# Part 2 — Persistence

Part 1's application holds no state. This part gives it a database, and
introduces the three pieces that surround one: entities, migrations, and
repositories.

## Stage 2.1 — A database to talk to

```bash
docker run -d --name flight-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=flight -e POSTGRES_DB=app_dev \
  -p 55432:5432 postgres:16
```

Port 55432 rather than 5432, deliberately: a starter project should not fight
whatever is already on the default port.

Add to `flight.yaml`:

```yaml
datasource:
  primary:
    url: "postgres://postgres:flight@127.0.0.1:55432/app_dev?sslmode=disable"
    pool_size: 5
```

`pool_size` is a real ceiling, not a hint. Every request that touches a
repository holds one connection for that request's whole life, so five is
five concurrent database-touching requests. Raise it, or shorten your units
of work — but know which one you are doing.

`sslmode=disable` is correct for a local container and wrong everywhere else.
Note that `require` does **not** verify certificates; `verify-full` does.

## Stage 2.2 — The package gains a database

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Swift-Flight/flight.git", from: "0.1.0"),
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Swift-Flight/flight-data.git",
             from: "0.1.0", traits: ["Postgres"]),
],
```

**That `traits:` argument is doing real work.** `flight-data` carries the
Postgres driver, the Valkey driver, the in-memory cache, and the data
protocols. Without the `Postgres` trait, PostgresNIO is not merely unused —
it is never resolved, never fetched, and never appears in your
`Package.resolved`. Add `"Valkey"` alongside it when you want that adapter
too.

Add `FlightDataPostgres` to the `App` target's dependencies, and two new
targets:

```swift
.target(
    name: "Migrations",
    dependencies: [.product(name: "FlightMigrate", package: "flight-data")],
    plugins: [.plugin(name: "FlightMigratePlugin", package: "flight-data")]
),
.executableTarget(
    name: "migrate",
    dependencies: [
        "Migrations",
        .product(name: "FlightMigrateCLI", package: "flight-data"),
    ]
),
```

Migrations live in their own target, and **the app target does not depend on
it**. Migrations are something you run, not something your server does while
booting. A server that migrates on startup is a server that races itself when
you run two of them.

## Stage 2.3 — An entity

`Sources/App/Entities/User.swift`:

```swift
import FlightDataPostgres
import FlightWeb
import Foundation

@Entity("users")
struct User: Encodable, Equatable, Sendable, ResponseEncodable {
    @ID var id: UUID
    var name: String
    var email: String
    @Column("createdAt") var createdAt: Date
    @Column("updatedAt") var updatedAt: Date
}
```

`@Entity` generates a typed column set. Queries are checked at compile time:
`User.where { $0.emial == x }` does not compile, and neither does comparing a
`String` column to an `Int`. A typo is a build error rather than a runtime
surprise or, worse, a query that silently matches nothing.

`@Column` is needed only where the Swift name and the SQL name differ.

Note what `User` is **not**: `Decodable`. Entities go out as JSON; what comes
back in should be a request type of its own. Once an association has crossed
the wire as `null`, "not loaded" and "loaded and empty" are indistinguishable,
and the type refuses to guess between them.

## Stage 2.4 — A migration

```bash
FLIGHT_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:flight@127.0.0.1:55432/app_dev \
  swift run migrate create CreateUsers
```

That writes a timestamped file into `Sources/Migrations`. Fill it in:

```swift
import FlightMigrate
import Foundation

struct CreateUsers: Migration {
    func up(_ schema: SchemaBuilder) {
        schema.createTable("users") { t in
            t.uuid("id").primaryKey().default(.uuid)
            t.varchar("name", limit: 30).notNull()
            t.varchar("email", limit: 50).notNull().unique()
            t.timestamptz("createdAt").notNull().default(.now)
            t.timestamptz("updatedAt").notNull().default(.now)
        }
    }

    func down(_ schema: SchemaBuilder) {
        schema.dropTable("users")
    }
}
```

Two things worth internalising:

**Column names must match the entity exactly.** Property names map to columns
with no case conversion, so a convenience helper emitting `created_at` would
silently miss `createdAt`. Spell them out.

**Every migration says how to undo itself.** That is what makes `migrate down`
something you run rather than something you fear.

Applied migrations are checksummed. Edit one that has already run and the
tool tells you, rather than letting your database and your code quietly
disagree.

### Checkpoint

```bash
export FLIGHT_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:flight@127.0.0.1:55432/app_dev
swift run migrate status     # one pending
swift run migrate up         # applies it
swift run migrate status     # one applied
swift run migrate down       # rolls it back
swift run migrate up
```

The CLI reads `FLIGHT_DATABASE_URL`, not `flight.yaml` — a migration tool
should be explicit about which database it is about to alter.

## Stage 2.5 — A repository, and the seam in front of it

Two files. First the seam, `Sources/App/Repos/UserRepositoryProtocol.swift`:

```swift
import FlightDataPostgres
import Foundation

protocol UserRepositoryProtocol: Sendable {
    func all() async throws -> [User]
    func find(byID id: UUID) async throws -> User?
    func find(byEmail email: String) async throws -> User?
    func create(name: String, email: String) async throws -> User
}
```

Then the implementation, `Sources/App/Repos/UserRepository.swift`:

```swift
import FlightDataPostgres
import Foundation

@Repository(scope: .scoped)
struct UserRepository: UserRepositoryProtocol {
    @Autowired var repo: Repo

    func all() async throws -> [User] {
        try await repo.all(User.all.order { $0.createdAt.desc() })
    }

    func find(byID id: UUID) async throws -> User? {
        try await repo.one(User.where { $0.id == id })
    }

    func find(byEmail email: String) async throws -> User? {
        try await repo.one(User.where { $0.email == email })
    }

    func create(name: String, email: String) async throws -> User {
        let now = Date()
        return try await repo.insert(
            User(id: UUID(), name: name, email: email, createdAt: now, updatedAt: now))
    }
}
```

**Why the protocol?** A struct wrapping a live database scope cannot be
swapped out. A protocol can. That is the entire reason Stage 2.7's tests can
run the real controller, real routing, and real dependency injection with no
database in the loop. Depend on the protocol everywhere except at
registration.

**Why `.scoped`?** One instance per request, holding one pooled connection for
that request. Resolve one outside a scope and you get an error rather than a
surprise connection.

Finally, tell the container about Postgres — in `Main.swift`:

```swift
static var dependencies: [any FlightModule.Type] {
    [PostgresDataModule<PrimaryDataSource>.self]
}
```

## Stage 2.6 — Routes

`Sources/App/Controllers/UserController.swift`:

```swift
@Controller
struct UserController {

    @GetMapping("/users")
    func list(_ context: RequestContext) async throws -> [User] {
        try await context.resolve((any UserRepositoryProtocol).self).all()
    }

    @GetMapping("/users/:id")
    func get(_ context: RequestContext) async throws -> User {
        guard let id = context.pathParam("id").flatMap({ UUID(uuidString: $0) }) else {
            throw HTTPError(.badRequest, "user id must be a UUID")
        }
        let users = try context.resolve((any UserRepositoryProtocol).self)
        guard let user = try await users.find(byID: id) else {
            throw HTTPError(.notFound, "no user \(id)")
        }
        return user
    }

    @PostMapping("/users")
    func create(_ context: RequestContext, body: CreateUserRequest) async throws -> Response {
        let users = try context.resolve((any UserRepositoryProtocol).self)

        let changeset = Changeset(User.self)
            .change(\.name, body.name)
            .change(\.email, body.email)
            .validate(\.email, .email)
        guard changeset.isValid else {
            throw HTTPError(.badRequest, "invalid user: \(changeset.errors)")
        }
        guard try await users.find(byEmail: body.email) == nil else {
            throw HTTPError(.conflict, "that email is already registered")
        }
        return try .json(await users.create(name: body.name, email: body.email), status: .created)
    }
}
```

Handlers stay thin on purpose: resolve, delegate, translate failures into
status codes. The controller is the only layer that should know what a 404 is;
the repository is the only layer that should know SQL.

**Changesets run before SQL does.** A changeset collects changes, validates
them, and only a valid one reaches the database. An invalid email never
becomes a query.

The full file, including `CreateUserRequest`, is in
[`templates/basics`](templates/basics/Sources/App/Controllers/UserController.swift).

### Checkpoint

```bash
swift run App &
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/users -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"name":"Ada","email":"ada@example.com"}'          # → 201
curl localhost:8080/users                                    # → [Ada]
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/users -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"name":"Nope","email":"nonsense"}'                 # → 400
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/users -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"name":"Ada 2","email":"ada@example.com"}'         # → 409
kill %1
```

## Stage 2.7 — Testing without a database

Because the controller depends on `(any UserRepositoryProtocol)`, a test can
register a fake under that key and exercise everything above it for real. The
complete suite is in
[`templates/basics`](templates/basics/Tests/AppTests/UserControllerTests.swift);
the shape is:

```swift
private struct TestModule: FlightModule {
    let users: InMemoryUsers

    func configure(_ container: Container) throws {
        try UserController._flightRegister(container)
        let users = self.users
        container.register((any UserRepositoryProtocol).self, scope: .scoped) { _ in users }
    }
}
```

The controller is registered through **its own macro-generated thunk** —
exactly what `flightRegisterAll` calls in production. Only the bottommost
seam is swapped. There is no mock framework and no proxy: a fake is a type
conforming to the protocol.

### Checkpoint

```bash
swift test        # 8 tests pass, no database required
```

**You have now built [`templates/basics`](templates/basics).**

---

# Part 3 — Real time

Part 2's application answers questions. This part makes it push — a chat room
where messages arrive live, you can see who else is in the room, and both are
correct across a cluster rather than only on one machine.

Four layers arrive here, and they stack:

| Layer | Owns |
|---|---|
| **PubSub** | Fan-out. Publish to a topic; subscribers get it, on one node or twenty |
| **Channels** | The per-connection protocol over a WebSocket: join, events, replies, heartbeats |
| **Presence** | "Who is in this topic", CRDT-merged across the cluster |
| **Security** | Turning a token into a `Principal`, and the guards that check one |

Part 3 is longer than the first two together, so it is split by concern.
[`templates/demo`](templates/demo) is the finished result at every point.

## Stage 3.1 — The chat schema

The demo's schema adds rooms, messages, topics, and a join table. The
migrations are in
[`templates/demo/Sources/Migrations`](templates/demo/Sources/Migrations) — copy
them and run `swift run migrate up`.

The shapes worth noticing, because Part 3 leans on all of them:

- `messages.roomID` — an ordinary foreign key, giving a has-many.
- `messages.authorID` — **nullable**, so the association is over an optional
  key. A message from someone who never registered belongs to nobody.
- `messages.parentID` — a self-reference, read with an aliased self-join.
- `messages.mentions` — a Postgres `text[]`, which needs nothing special:
  `Column<[String]>` falls out of the ordinary generic path.

## Stage 3.2 — Authentication, brought rather than built

Flight Security Core is a **resource server**. It validates tokens somebody
else issued. There is no login form, no session table, and no password
hashing anywhere in it — that is deliberate, and it is the single most
important thing to understand about this layer.

The seam is one protocol:

```swift
public protocol TokenValidator: Sendable {
    func validate(_ token: String) async throws -> Principal
}
```

The shipped implementation is a generic OIDC validator that any compliant
provider — Keycloak, Auth0, Okta, Entra, Descope — is *configuration* of, not
a fork of. Two keys are usually enough:

```yaml
security:
  oidc:
    issuer: https://your-tenant.example.com/
    audience: your-app
```

Signature verification delegates to JWTKit. Flight owns orchestration only.

For a tutorial that runs with no identity provider, the demo registers its
own validator instead —
[`DemoTokenValidator`](templates/demo/Sources/App/Security/DemoTokenValidator.swift),
which accepts `demo:ada:moderator` and does no cryptography at all. Register
it **before** `FlightSecurityModule` and the module finds one present and
stands down:

```swift
container.register((any TokenValidator).self, scope: .singleton) { _ in
    DemoTokenValidator()
}
```

That is the bring-your-own-auth seam, and the demo file exists to show it.
**Delete it in anything real** and configure `security.oidc.*`. Rolling your
own token format is exactly the mistake this layer is shaped to prevent; the
demo gets away with it only because its tokens grant access to a chat room on
your laptop.

Guarding a route is a line in the handler:

```swift
try context.requireRole("moderator")
```

401 with no principal, 403 with the wrong one. Registering
`requireAuthentication` as middleware instead protects *every* route — right
for an internal service, wrong for an app whose reads are public.

## Stage 3.3 — A channel

A `Channel` is per-topic server logic. Joining creates one instance per
(socket, topic), so one registration serves every room:

```swift
container.registerChannel("room:*") { c in
    RoomChannel(
        broadcaster: try c.resolve(ChannelBroadcaster.self),
        presence: try c.resolve((any Presence).self),
        chat: try c.resolve((any RoomStore).self),
        digests: try c.resolve(RoomDigestService.self))
}

container.registerChannelSocket("/socket") { context in
    guard let token = context.request.queryParam("token") else { return nil }
    return try? await context.resolve((any TokenValidator).self).validate(token)
}
```

**Identity is established during the HTTP upgrade**, before the WebSocket
exists — while there is still an HTTP response to fail with. The token
arrives as a query parameter because browsers cannot set headers on a
WebSocket handshake. Returning `nil` admits an anonymous socket, which every
`join` below then rejects.

The channel itself, abridged from
[`RoomChannel.swift`](templates/demo/Sources/App/Channels/RoomChannel.swift):

```swift
func join(_ topic: String, socket: Socket) async -> JoinResult {
    guard let principal = socket.principal else { return .reject(.unauthenticated) }
    guard let slug = Self.roomSlug(from: topic) else {
        return .reject(JoinRejection("malformed_topic"))
    }
    guard let room = try? await chat.room(slug: slug, messageLimit: 0), !room.archived else {
        return .reject(JoinRejection("no_such_room"))
    }

    await presence.track(topic: topic, key: principal.subject,
                         payload: ["status": "online"], socket: socket)
    await presence.sendState(topic: topic, to: socket)

    return .ok(initialState: ["room": .string(room.slug)])
}
```

**The join is the authorization gate.** By the time an application frame can
arrive, the question of who this is has already been settled.

Note `roomSlug` refusing `"room:"`. Dropping the prefix leaves an empty
string, and treating that as a room named `""` would create presence lists for
a room nobody can name. Refuse rather than coerce.

## Stage 3.4 — Ordering, and the bug it prevents

Handling a message is short, and the order of two lines is the whole lesson:

```swift
let stored = try await chat.post([message])       // 1. persist

await broadcaster.broadcast(                       // 2. then fan out
    topic: event.topic, event: "new_msg",
    payload: Self.wire(stored.first ?? message),
    excluding: socket)

return .reply(Self.wire(stored.first ?? message))
```

A message that fans out to twenty subscribers and *then* fails to insert has
been read by everyone and exists for no one, and no retry puts that back.
Writing first means the worst case is a message that is durable but arrives
late — which the client's next history fetch repairs on its own.

`excluding: socket` keeps the sender from seeing their own message twice:
they get the canonical row as the reply, so the broadcast is for everybody
else.

**Fan-out is PubSub's job, not the channel's.** That `broadcast` reaches
subscribers on every node in the cluster; this code never learns how many
nodes there are. Anything holding a `ChannelBroadcaster` can call it — a
handler, a background job, another node. The demo's REST `POST /messages`
does exactly that, so a message posted over HTTP reaches everyone currently
watching over a socket:

```swift
let broadcaster = try context.resolve(ChannelBroadcaster.self)
for message in stored {
    await broadcaster.broadcast(topic: "room:\(message.room)",
                                event: "new_msg", payload: RoomChannel.wire(message))
}
```

Two write paths, one wire shape, one `wire(_:)` function producing it. If
those ever diverge, clients see the same message in two shapes depending on
how it was sent.

## Stage 3.5 — Presence

Presence answers "who is here" for the whole cluster, merged with a CRDT — so
reordered or duplicated gossip is harmless and replicas converge with no
leader, no locks, and no synchronized clocks.

Two calls in `join` were all it took, and there is **no matching call to
remove anyone**. Tracking is bound to the socket's membership of the topic, so
every teardown path — client leave, dropped transport, heartbeat timeout,
server shutdown — untracks structurally. There is nothing to remember.

One identity can be present many times: three browser tabs are one **key**
with three **metas**. Closing one tab removes one meta and leaves the person
present. Collapsing that to a list of names would lose the distinction the
whole data structure exists to keep, which is why the demo's
`GET /rooms/:slug/who` reports a connection count alongside each name.

Clients get one `flight:presence_state` on join, then `flight:presence_diff`s.
Both reference clients maintain the list for you: `FlightPresenceClient` in
Swift, `@flight/channels/presence` in JavaScript.

## Stage 3.6 — Caching the expensive reads

Two of the demo's queries are worth caching — a `GROUP BY … HAVING` over every
message, and a `DISTINCT ON` across every room. Both are expensive, both are
polled by dashboards, and both tolerate being a few seconds stale.

```swift
@Service(scope: .singleton)
struct RoomDigestService {
    @Autowired var chat: ChatRepository

    @Cacheable(namespace: "room-digest", ttl: .seconds(30))
    func activity(minimumMessages: Int) async throws -> [RoomActivity] {
        try await chat.activity(minimumMessages: minimumMessages)
    }

    @CacheEvict(namespace: "room-digest", allEntries: true)
    func messagesChanged() async {}
}
```

`@Cacheable` expands **into the method body**, not into a proxy wrapping the
type. That difference matters: a call from one method of this type to another
still goes through the cache, because there is no proxy to bypass. The
equivalent Spring footgun cannot occur here.

The cache coalesces: fifty concurrent misses on one key compute once and
forty-nine wait, rather than fifty queries hitting the database together.

Arguments are part of the key, so `?min=3` and `?min=10` are separate
entries. And **both** write paths — REST and WebSocket — call
`messagesChanged()`, because a cache the two paths disagree about is a cache
that lies to half your users.

`FlightCacheModule` is in-memory by default. Swapping in Valkey is a module
change and a trait, not a code change.

## Stage 3.7 — Wiring it together

`AppModule` now names what the app is made of:

```swift
static var dependencies: [any FlightModule.Type] {
    [
        PostgresDataModule<PrimaryDataSource>.self,
        FlightPubSubModule.self,
        FlightChannelsModule.self,
        FlightPresenceModule.self,
        FlightCacheModule.self,
        FlightSecurityModule.self,
    ]
}
```

One line each. The DAG orders them; you do not.

One bridge is needed, and it is worth understanding rather than copying:

```swift
extension Principal: @retroactive ChannelPrincipal {}
```

Flight Security's `Principal` and Flight Channels' `ChannelPrincipal` are
deliberately unrelated — Channels has no dependency on Security, so the
WebSocket layer works with any notion of identity, or none. They meet in
**your** code. The conformance is empty because `Principal` already has
everything the protocol asks for.

### Checkpoint

```bash
swift run App &

TOKEN=demo:ada:moderator
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/rooms -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"slug":"general","name":"General","greeting":"hello"}'
curl localhost:8080/rooms/general/who        # → [] — nobody connected yet
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/messages/redact -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"sender":"ada","roomSlug":"general"}'          # → 401, no token
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/messages/redact \
     -H "authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"sender":"ada","roomSlug":"general"}'          # → 200
kill %1
```

For the WebSocket half, connect to
`ws://localhost:8080/socket?token=demo:ada`, join `room:general`, and push a
`new_msg`. Two browser tabs will see each other's messages and each other's
presence.

### Checkpoint

```bash
swift test        # 24 tests, no database and no network required
```

That suite runs the real Channels router, the real PubSub fan-out, and the
real Presence CRDT against an in-memory store — including tests asserting
that a message is persisted before it is broadcast, and that a failed write
broadcasts nothing.

**You have now built [`templates/demo`](templates/demo).**

# Where to go next

- **Swap the demo validator** for real OIDC: delete
  `Sources/App/Security/DemoTokenValidator.swift` and set `security.oidc.*`.
- **Add a second node.** Presence and PubSub are already cluster-correct; a
  distributed PubSub adapter is a module.
- **Move the cache to Valkey**: add the `Valkey` trait and swap the module.
- **Read the Hangar tour** in
  [`ChatRepository.swift`](templates/demo/Sources/App/Repos/ChatRepository.swift)
  — three-table joins, a table joined to itself, `DISTINCT ON`, set-based
  writes, upserts, row locks under a serializable transaction with retry,
  `Multi`, and streaming.

# Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| Build asks you to trust a plugin | Expected on a first build: the registration and migrate plugins are SwiftPM build plugins. Approve them. |
| Bootstrap fails naming `datasource.primary.url` | `flight.yaml` missing or mistyped, or you are not running from the project directory. |
| Bootstrap fails dialing the pool | Postgres container not running, or wrong port/password. |
| Build error naming a `@ConfigValue` key | The plugin checks keys without defaults against `flight.yaml` at build time. Add the key, or give it a `default:`. |
| `migrate` cannot connect | `FLIGHT_DATABASE_URL` is unset in this shell. The CLI does not read `flight.yaml`. |
| `checksum mismatch` from migrate | You edited a migration that already ran. Write a new one, or `migrate repair` if the edit was cosmetic. |
| `noActiveScope` at runtime | A `.scoped` component was resolved outside any scope. Resolve via `context.resolve` in handlers. |
| `poolExhausted` under load | Every concurrent request touching a repository holds a connection for its whole life. Raise `pool_size`, or shorten the unit of work. |
| A join is rejected with `unauthenticated` | The socket connected without a `?token=`, or the validator rejected it. |
| `swift run` says there are multiple executables | Name one: `swift run App`, `swift run migrate`. |
| Port already bound | `FLIGHT_SERVER_PORT=9090 swift run App`. |
