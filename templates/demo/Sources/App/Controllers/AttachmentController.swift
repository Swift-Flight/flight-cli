/// File upload, both halves of flight 0.7.0 at once: the handler takes
/// `body: RequestBodyStream`, so the transport hands bytes through as they
/// arrive instead of buffering the request — that (plus `maxBodyBytes:`
/// overriding the global cap for just this route) is what lets an upload
/// accept far more than any sane global body limit. The stream feeds
/// `request.multipart()`, which parses parts without ever holding a file
/// in memory.
///
/// The demo digests instead of storing: what to *do* with uploaded bytes
/// (disk layout, object storage, virus scanning) is an application
/// decision this template shouldn't make for you, while the wire handling
/// is exactly what you'd keep. Swap the hasher loop for writes to your
/// storage of choice and the rest stands.
