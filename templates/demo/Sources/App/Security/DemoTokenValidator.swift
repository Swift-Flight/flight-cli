/// A `TokenValidator` the demo can run without an identity provider.
///
/// This is the **bring-your-own-auth seam**, and it is the whole point of the
/// file. Flight Security Core ships one generic `OIDCTokenValidator` that any
/// standards-compliant provider — Keycloak, Auth0, Okta, Entra, Descope — is
/// merely *configuration* of. Registering a different `(any TokenValidator)`
/// before `FlightSecurityModule` replaces it wholesale; the module checks for
/// an existing registration and steps aside.
///
/// A real deployment deletes this file and sets `security.oidc.issuer` and
/// `security.oidc.audience` instead. It exists so the demo is runnable with
/// `curl` and no infrastructure — and so the seam has a worked example rather
/// than only prose.
///
/// The "tokens" it accepts are deliberately not JWTs and carry no signature.
/// Nothing here does cryptography, because pretending to would teach the
/// wrong lesson: real token verification is delegated to JWTKit, and the one
/// place this demo could plausibly hand-roll a security primitive is the one
/// place it refuses to.
