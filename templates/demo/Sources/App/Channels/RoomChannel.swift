/// The live half of the chat room: `ChatController` is its history, this is
/// its present tense.
///
/// One registration serves every room — the pattern is `room:*`, and Channels
/// creates one instance per (socket, topic), so `topic` identifies which room
/// this instance is holding.
///
/// Three layers meet here and each keeps its own job:
///
/// - **Channels** owns the per-connection protocol: join, events, replies.
/// - **PubSub** does the fan-out, so a broadcast reaches subscribers on every
///   node without this code knowing whether there is one node or twenty.
/// - **Presence** answers "who is in this room", CRDT-merged across the
///   cluster. Nothing here ever *removes* a presence: tracking is bound to
///   the socket's membership, so every teardown path — client leave, dropped
///   transport, heartbeat timeout, shutdown — untracks structurally.
