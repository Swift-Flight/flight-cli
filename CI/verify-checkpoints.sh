# Runs the tutorial's checkpoints for real.
#
# Each Part of TUTORIAL.md ends its stages with a "### Checkpoint" — a command
# and what you should see. Those are the tutorial's strongest feature and were
# its least verified part: verify-tutorial.sh checks that paths exist and
# symbols resolve, which is why `swift run migrate up` and `migrate down` sat
# in a checkpoint for weeks despite neither being a subcommand.
#
# This extracts every checkpoint block, runs it in the tier that Part builds,
# and fails if any command exits non-zero.
#
# What it does NOT check: the `# → …` comments. A curl that returns 404 still
# exits 0, so the commands are proven to *run*, not to produce what the
# tutorial claims. Asserting on output would mean parsing prose; the tests in
# each template cover the behaviour instead.
#
# Some checkpoints are interactive by design — Stage 1.3's is `swift run App`,
# which serves until you press Ctrl-C. Those cannot "finish", so every block
# runs under a timeout and a block still running when it expires counts as a
# pass: a server that is up after the deadline is a server that started.
#
# Needs FLIGHT_TEST_DATABASE_URL for Part 2 onward. Skips those, loudly,
# without it.
